        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Prakash Kulkarni, an Australian citizen currently living in the Czech Republic for the past 18 years. I hold a bachelor’s degree in software engineering from Western Sydney University, where I graduated with distinction. With over 20 years of experience in the IT industry, I’ve held various roles, from Help Desk positions to my most recent role as Executive Director.

            Aside from my career in IT, I’ve always had a passion for cooking, which began in my childhood. While studying in Sydney, I worked in restaurants and at the Sydney Convention Center as a bar and wait staff. These experiences helped me develop my culinary skills, and over the past few years, I’ve enjoyed preparing meals for the local community.
            
            I am also deeply committed to education, particularly in helping children and adults improve their English. Since moving to the Czech Republic, I’ve noticed the limited access to English language education. Both my children are bilingual, and I’ve seen how this gives them an edge. This inspired me to tutor kids in English, as well as provide mentorship and career guidance to young adults. I also offer conversational English sessions for adults who feel they’ve lost some of their fluency due to a lack of regular exposure.
